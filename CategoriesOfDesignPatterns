Creational Patterns:

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, abstracting the instantiation process. They provide flexibility in creating objects while hiding the details of the creation process. Examples include:
Factory Method Pattern
Abstract Factory Pattern
Singleton Pattern
Builder Pattern
Prototype Pattern
Structural Patterns:

These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They help to create interfaces between objects to make them work together effectively. Examples include:
Adapter Pattern
Bridge Pattern
Composite Pattern
Decorator Pattern
Facade Pattern
Proxy Pattern
Behavioral Patterns:

These patterns are concerned with communication, collaboration, and interaction between objects. They provide solutions to effectively manage the behavior of objects. Examples include:
Observer Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Command Pattern
Iterator Pattern
Template Method Pattern
Chain of Responsibility Pattern
State Pattern
Visitor Pattern
Each of these categories addresses different aspects of software design, providing solutions for common design problems and promoting better maintainability, reusability, and flexibility in the software.
